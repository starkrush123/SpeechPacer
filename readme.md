## “Pausing Information” add-on for NVDA

## Description
The “Pausing Information” add-on for NVDA is an extension that provides a more detailed and paused reading of control and status information when the focus shifts between interface elements. This feature was inspired by the Brazilian screen reader “Virtual Vision”, known for its paused way of announcing information, improving user comprehension.

## Features
1. **Announcement of Control Types and States**:
- The add-on announces the type of control (e.g. “checkbox”, “radio button”, “menu”, “edit box”) and its states (e.g. “unavailable”, “busy”).
- The announcement is made in a paused manner, as was done by the Virtual Vision screen reader.

2. **Handling of List and Menu Items**:
- For list items, the add-on announces the item's position in the list (e.g. “1 of 5”).
- For menu items, if available, the add-on announces the shortcut key associated with the menu item (e.g. “Open... Alt+A”).

3. **Icon Announcement in Alt+Tab**:
- When using the Alt+Tab feature to switch between windows, the add-on announces the position of the icon in the window list (e.g. “icon 1 of 3”).

4. **Reading Selected Text**:
- When you select text in an edit box using Shift+the arrow keys, the add-on reads the selected text.
Note: This feature is not fully functional and may fail in some cases.

## Usage
After installation, the add-on works automatically, providing a more detailed and paused reading of control and status information. Although not perfect, it works relatively well and no additional configuration is required.

## Future development
This add-on was created as a prototype, with the aim of later being integrated into the DeltaTalk synthesizer add-on for NVDA, after a few more adjustments, because as already mentioned, it is not yet fully functional. Special thanks to Chat GPT for their exhaustive collaboration in the development of this project.
